# E-pedigrees

E-pdigrees combines two validated family prediction algorithms (FPPA and RIFTEHR) into a single software package for high throughput pedigrees construction. The convenient software considers patientsâ€™ basic demographic information and/or emergency contact data to infer high-accuracy parent-child relationship. Importantly, E-Pedigrees allows users to layer in additional pedigree data when available and provides options for applying different logical rules to improve accuracy of inferred family relationships. You can refer to two papers for the details of two core algorithms. ["Applying family analyses to electronic health
records to facilitate genetic research"](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/4/635/4158031) and ["Disease Heritability Inferred from Familial Relationships Reported in Medical Records"](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30525-7.pdf).



## Input and output requirements:

Run main.py with required input files and correct format.

Our code is compatible with most format of Electronic Health Records system, you can provide options of de-identified files as inputs:
1. Basic demographic information:
   - Address file
   - Name file
   - Demographic file
   - Account file
2. Self-reported relationship data:
   - Patient file
   - Emergency contact file
3. Family pedigree file in standard PED format:
   - pedigree file
  

### Address file

The address file is a csv comma delimited file containing eight columns: **study_id**, **street_1**, **street_2**, **city**, **state**, **zip**, **from_year** and **thru_year**. The **study_id** is the de-identified id for a single patient. The **street_1**, **street_2**, **city**, **state** and **zip** are the de-identified address. The **from_year** and **thru_year** shows from which year through which year this patient lived in this address. Note that all missing information will be shown as blank.

### Output files

Eventually we will get one output files: 1. parent_child relathionship file and pedigree file.
The parent_child relationship file is an intermediate txt file which records the predicted parent_child relationship between a pair of patients. The pedigree file is the final output family pedigrees csv file in standard PED format which contains six colums: 1. randomly assgined family ID, 2. number of family members, 3. patient's de-identified study id, 4. this patient's mother's de-identified study id, 5. this patient's father's de-identified study id and 6. gender code of this patient.
